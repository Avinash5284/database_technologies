#1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one customer into this table.                        
      show databases;
      use assignment;
      
      create table multicast AS 
      select * from salespeople where snum IN (select snum from customers GROUP BY snum HAVING count(snum)>1);
      
      select * from multicast;
      
#2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders. 
      
      INSERT into customers values(2012,'sagar','satara',500,1005);
      savepoint s1;
      
      DELETE from customers
      WHERE cnum = ANY 
      (select cnum from orders where cnum NOT IN (select cnum from customers));
      
  #3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.     
  
  
     select * from salespeople;
     
     UPDATE salespeople SET comm=comm*1.20
     where snum IN 
     (select snum from orders where amt > 3000);
